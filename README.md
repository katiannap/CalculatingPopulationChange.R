# CalculatingPopulationChange.

I worked at the UN in urban planning and am interested in tracking population growth across major metropolitan regions. I am hoping that by looking at historical population numbers that I can predict future growth and help my team make decisions about resourcing.

I used my knowledge of R to calculate the population growth of Istanbul and create a short report. I did this by creating and using variables to perform calculations and calling functions with correct arguments.
